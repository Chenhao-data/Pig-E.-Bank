# Pig-E.-Bank
I used Python to wrangle and analyze several datasets for Pig-E.-Bank. I then created a report that communicates my analysis process and my results and recommendations to key business questions from Pig E. Bank.

##  Objective
One of the data analysts for the sales team recently left Pig E. Bank, so I’ve agreed to take their place and help out with a customer retention project.

## Goal
Identify the top risk factors that contribute to client loss and model them in a decision tree.

## Data
Pig E. Bank's Data Set - This dataset was created by CareerFoundry for use in this analysis. The data set includes customer ids, last names, credit scores, country, gender, age, tenure, balance, number of products, if they have a credit card, if they are an active member, estimated salary, and if they have exited from the bank. 

## Tools
The data was analyzed using Python and the following libraries:

● Pandas: for data analysis

● Numpy: for mathematical equations
